    <p>From my academia I had the opportunity to take a machine learning class. We got learn about regression, model building and the theory that goes into it. To demonstrate our learning we where asked to build a 
    supervised machine learning algorithm to classify and identify Lego pieces. To tackle this problem I first knew data cleaning would be required and formatting. I loaded all of the training model images into an 
    array and then proceeded to change them all to grayscale as it is easier to work with pixel colors of 0-255 rather than RGB. I then changed the image structure to be presented as its numerical value. This presented 
    the numbers as an array and I associated each array entry to its classified label. By performing a logistical regression with a multi-class perception rather the one vs all, I was able to achieve a recognition 
    rate of 94% from the testing model. This accuracy was sufficient for the course but could be altered by introducing a soft max cost function to refine the boundaries.</p>
