    List of projects I have undergone throughout my degree or at my own leisure
    </p>


    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

    <img src="../lego2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 350px" alt="grayscale lego">
    <img src="../feature.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 350px" alt="feature map">
    <p>From my academia I had the opportunity to take a machine learning class. We got learn about regression, model building and the theory that goes into it. To demonstrate our learning we where asked to build a 
    supervised machine learning algorithm to classify and identify Lego pieces. To tackle this problem I first knew data cleaning would be required and formatting. I loaded all of the training model images into an 
    array and then proceeded to change them all to grayscale as it is easier to work with pixel colors of 0-255 rather than RGB. I then changed the image structure to be presented as its numerical value. This presented 
    the numbers as an array and I associated each array entry to its classified label. By performing a logistical regression with a multi-class perception rather the one vs all, I was able to achieve a recognition 
    rate of 94% from the testing model. This accuracy was sufficient for the course but could be altered by introducing a soft max cost function to refine the boundaries.</p>

    <h2>Data Analytics</h2>

    <img src="../tableu_trees.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 350px" alt="Tree Planted Dashboard">
    <p>I had the opportunity to explore a very large data set of my choosing and to refine/clean the data. Naturally being a hockey fan I choose to use collected NHL data from the last
    10 years and perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). From this I was able to look at various collected stats and form a couple of interesting conclusions on average shift length, best coach, best team... etc.
    To present my findings I created a Tableau Dashboard as it is more visually appearing for the average viewer rather than looking at code and a result. From this project I grew an appreciation
    for advanced stats in sports as I got to see stats from teams at a lower level rather than just if they won or lost.

    <h2>Capstone</h2>

    <img src="../Capstone_transmitter.png" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 350px" alt="FSO transmitter">
    <img src="../Capstone_transmitter2.png" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 350px" alt="FSO transmitter2">
    <p>For my last full year of academia I had the pleasure and opportunity to lead a group of colleagues in the development of Free-Space Optical Communication system. We underwent research
    and development to fully meet deliverables set out by our supervising professor while achieving a fully functional prototype. The idea behind our communication system was to implement the idea of fibre
    optic without the fibre optic line. This was done by using a laser diode with TTL modulation transmitting a signal to a receiving photodiode. We worked with a 980nm Laser diode as safety
    was at the upmost importance and at 980nm we could keep the Max Permissible Exposure low with minimizing the affects to our overall goal.</p>
    
    <h2>Cadence Design</h2>
    <img src="../ten_transistor.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="height:400px; width: 600px" alt="Full Adder>">
    <img src="../ten_transistor_layout.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="height:400px; width: 500px" alt="Full Adder">
    <p>For my cadence design project I was tasked with building and optimizing a 6-bit full adder from the transistor level. To tackle this I spent a lot of time researching
    papers and development of a traditional full adder and looked for areas where transistors could be reduced. I quickly was able to identify that by using a SERF adder I could lower the traditional
    gates used from 28 down to 12. With this drastic reduction the speed of the full adder was able to be optimized to 307.5ps from 15ns. I then produced the associated layout
    design for the full-adder and stayed with in 130nm technology parameters. </p>

    <h2>Processor Development - IN PROGRESS</h2>

    <p>Please check back later in the year as I am currrently working on this project :)</p>
